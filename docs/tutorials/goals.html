        <h2 id="what-are-the-goals-for-this-learning-material">What are the goals for this learning material?</h2>
<p>To start, I should explain my motivation in writing this. Several of my friends have asked me for help breaking into programming, either for career reasons or out of their own personal interest. Many of these friends (including my beautiful and lovely male girlfriend) have limited technical background, and so I intend this tutorial to be an introduction to both computer programming and the Haskell programming language.</p>
<p>By the end of this tutorial series, a reader should be able to independently write useful programs in the Haskell programming language. Importantly, a reader should feel comfortable acquiring new information online, and feel able to continue learning and experimenting on their own. Some attention is given to employability, but knowledge should not suffer for capitalism’s sake.</p>
<p>This will involve learning more than just the Haskell programming language. Readers will also have to learn about how software is compiled (ex: build systems), how software development is recorded and organized (ex: version control), how program correctness is reasoned about, how programs are documented and communicated to other human beings, how they are run, and more.</p>
<p>Notably, I will not try to hide complexity. If a subject is complex, I want to write this guide in such a way that a student can compartmentalize that complexity, but still come back to it later if they have questions about how something interacts with something else, how it works in more general cases, how it works “in practice”, etc. I think it’s especially important that readers don’t feel stuck to this particular guide. I don’t want to write some book series for sale, I want readers to be able to consult other resources online to pick up where this tutorial might be lacking. This will also mean that I will try not to invent too much terminology, so readers can communicate effectively with programmers that have not read this tutorial, or don’t know Haskell.</p>
<p>The language of this guide will be in English. I might translate it to Spanish at some point if it picks up outside my immediate friend group. But I don’t currently speak any languages other than those two.</p>
<h2 id="target-demographic-requirements">Target demographic, requirements</h2>
<p>The goal of this tutorial is to teach students about computation from scratch. Unfortunately, I probably don’t have the time or money to teach students every single thing I’d like to, with truly 0 requirements.</p>
<p>Instead, I will assume some level of education with American highschool level algebra, and at least some kind of familiarity with computers. I understand education and experiences vary wildly, so I will try not to rely too hard on any particular concept previously taught. The goal is to only rely on loose knowledge of algebra, and loose computer knowledge.</p>
<p>If a reader doesn’t understand, for example, functions, the tutorial should be written such that they can feel comfortable searching online for what a function is. If a reader has only ever used Google Docs or Microsoft Word files, then the reader should feel comfortable searching for what a file is online. The point is to not rely on in depth rigorous knowledge of how function composition works, or how filesystems store file hierarchies, just that readers might have encountered files, functions, etc, before. Intuition and recognition, rather than in depth knowledge.</p>
<p>If you’d like to help contribute to this tutorial series, I would be glad to accept PR’s, though please realize this is a personal project and so I will probably be arbitrary with which PR’s I will accept and decline. I am less arbitrary with accepting offers of employment, so long as they are equal to or greater than my previous salary of ~88,000 USD.</p>
